In this project, your team is going to make use of these skills to come up with an idea of a new business/startup based upon data science technology. Your goal is to design a better service/solution on any data you like, develop a prototype/demo and prepare a pitch for your idea.\n",
    "* Your team needs to decide which business problem is important for the market you are joining in (for example, social media market, housing market, search market, etc.).\n",
    "* Then design a data science approach to improve one of the current services or design a new service on any data that you choose.\n",
    "* The solution should include all the three components of data science: 1) the business part to analyze the potential impact of your new/improved service, why the idea can make money, how much are you evaluating the company; How are you planing to persuade the sharks to invest in your business; 2) the mathematical part to formulate the problem and develop math solution; 3) the programming part to collect the data, implement the math solution, and develop the prototype/demo.\n"

    "**Please describe here *briefly*  (please edit this cell)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Your business problem to solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group has focused on the reccomendation market within the online travel company Expedia. Expedia books airline tickets, car rentals, cruises, vacation packages, and much more. In order for customers to take advantage of these bookings, they especially need a hotel. Expedia wants to take the proverbial rabbit hole out of hotel search by providing personalized hotel recommendations to their visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Why the problem is important to solve? \n",
    "\n",
    "When individuals, couples, or families are booking their dream vacation or weekend escapes, there can be hundreds, or even thoussands, of hotels to choose from at every destination. A hotel is the hub for any vacation, and if one arrives and finds their hotel recommendation inadequate, it could spell distaster for them and their partners. If however the recommendation suffices or exceeds their expectations, the quality of their vacation goes up and they are more likely to use Expedia for their future booking needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) What is your idea to solve the problem? \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall idea is to utilize collected customer behavior logs to enhance prediction of which hotel cluster customers would likely book at. These logs include information such as what the customer, searched for, how they interacted with the search results, whether or not the search result was a travel package, etc. With this data we can perform supervised classification machine learning algorithms for each user event and generate probabilities of where a user is most likely to enjoy staying.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) What differences could you make with your data science approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expedia has collected a plethora of information about its customers and their booking habbits. However, with a large amount of data collected, much of it provides much detail about where users will book. On one hand, having these large amounts of features or attributes of users lead to misleading and noisey recommendations. On the other hand, within the same data lies a structure or guide of how users choose and enjoy their hotel selections. Machine learning, and some feature engineering, can find this structure and remove some of this noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Why do you believe the idea deserves the investment of the \"sharks\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "When the economy started to boom out of the 2008 recession, millions of individuals, couples, and families could finally go on a vacation. During this time petabytes of customer data was collected, but has yet to be analyzed. With the near infinite computing power and storage available with todays technology, it is time to fully understand what makes our customers content. With a recession looming over our heads, vacationing will surely decline. But this does not mean money is not to be made. Those individuals that take vacations will mean that much more to them, and their customer loyalty when the economy booms again will be to Expedia only if we provide them with the best hotel options for their needs."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Problem formulation in Math:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer log behaviours from 2013 and 2014 are provided by Expedia. For each user event, the log contains 24 distinct attributes such as user id, check-in and check-out dates, hotel market, and origin to destination distance. These attributes can be seen as features describing each individual user event. We must generate probability distributions using this information for the likelyhood that a user event will be conducted in each of 100 hotel clusters. Using these probability distributions, we must classify each user event into a hotel cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Math Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Treating the customer log behaviour attributes as features, we will perform a Random Forest Classification. We believe this is a good classifier as Random Forests are known to deal with small samples (n) and large features (p) problems. Although there are hundreds of thousands of logs, there are 24 distinct attributes which makes classification relativly difficult using other classifiers. Random Forest Classification can generate probabilities for which we then can make predictions with. These predictions will then need to be evaluated using a metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Implementation of the Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be downloaded from the Kaggle website where Expedia has begun its competition. Graphical analysis of the data will first be conducted to understand some of the features better. After converting to a pandas dataframe and preprocessing the data for missing entries, we will use RandomForestClassifier to generate probabilities of hotel cluster likelyhood. We then will utilize the top 5 best probabilities for each user event and evaluate using a Mean Average Precision of 5 (MAP@5) equation.\n",
    "The results will then be compared to evaluations by other individuals and systems."
